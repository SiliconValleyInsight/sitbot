*Update as of July 24, 2018: Google Chrome currently does not let 3rd party Chrome extensions work in its browser. The only way we can make this extension work is to upload it to the Google Chrome Extension Store.*

## Download

[Click here](http://cl.ly/arfU) to download the latest version.

## Installation

1. Download the extension. It will be saved as `sitbot.crc`

2. Open Chrome and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)

3. Click and drag the `sitbot.crx` file into the Chrome extensions page

## Usage

### Searching GitHub

Fill in the fields and click the `Search GitHub` button.

The `Language` field is optional.

### Scraping GitHub profiles

**Sign in to GitHub.** Or else you will be rate limited and sitbot won't work.

Once you are on a GitHub search results page, click `Start Scraping`.

You can move the mouse around, but do not click anywere. Unfortunately, this causes the extension to close and stop scraping. This might be fixed in a future version.

When sitbot is done, you'll be able to download the scraped results to a `.csv` file. That file can then be imported into a Google Spreadsheet.
