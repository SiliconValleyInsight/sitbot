1. Download the extension file by clicking `download` then `Download ZIP` on the upper right of the page.

2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right. Refresh.

## Usage

### Searching GitHub

Fill in the fields and click the `Search GitHub` button.

The `Language` field is optional.

### Scraping GitHub profiles

**Sign in to GitHub.** Or else you will be rate limited and sitbot won't work.

Once you are on a GitHub search results page, click `Start Scraping`.

You can move the mouse around, but do not click anywere. Unfortunately, this causes the extension to close and stop scraping. This might be fixed in a future version.

When sitbot is done, you'll be able to download the scraped results to a `.csv` file. That file can then be imported into a Google Spreadsheet.
